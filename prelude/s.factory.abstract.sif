Description """
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent data structures without specifying their concrete implementations."""

Solution "Abstract OO Factories" solves adt in std {

   > Utilisation of a generic construction mechanism that contains

   > aside from the actual construction mechanism.  Concrete
   > mechanisms will extend the generic mechanism to perform
   > construction of the products. It is these concrete mechanisms
   > that are responsible for creating one or more concrete products,
   > and is the only mechanism with knowledge of this creation.
