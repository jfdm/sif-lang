    Pre-image resistance

        Given a hash value h it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of one-way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.

    Second pre-image resistance

        Given an input m1 it should be difficult to find different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second-preimage attacks.

    Collision resistance
        It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for preimage-resistance; otherwise collisions may be found by a birthday attack.
