In these environments these entities will have prescribed restrictions on the data and resources they can access. There needs to be a means to control access to resources, including information. The first step is to declare who is authorised to access resources in specific ways. Otherwise, any active entity (user, process) could access any resource and there would be confidentiality and integrity problems.

How do we describe who is authorised to access specific resources in a
system?"""
