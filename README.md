Named after the Norse God Sif who was renowned for his knowledge and
wisdom. Project MÃ­mir is provided as part of the doctoral research by
Jan de Muijnck-Hughes. In his research he looks to investigate how to
facilitate the uptake of novel cryptographic schemes through the use
of pattern languages.

## What is Sif-Lang

Sif is a _Domain Specific Language_ (DSL) for the specification of
pattern languages. This repository contains the specification for
sif-lang, and any tooling/runtime associated with the language.

## Repository Contents

Sif-lang has been built upon a GIT repository. The GIT repository
allows us to track the development of language. Different branches in
the repository reflect the different states that the language can be
in. There are two primary branches.

+ __Master__: The _Master_ branch contains finalised versions of the
  language.

+ __Development__: The _dev_ branch contains a version of the language
  that has yet to be finalised.
